In June 2020, I graduated from Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) with a Ph.D degree in Applied Mathematics. 
                I also earned my B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in Mathematics, from University of North Sumatera, Indonesia, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.
                In November 2020, I moved back to Indonesia for teaching in graduate program of BINUS university. In March 2023, I moved back to Taiwan 
				for a postdoc in the Department of applied mathematics, CYCU. I am currently seeking for a new position. If you are interested in me, 
				please drop me a message.


###### RESEARCH INTEREST
-   My research interest includes unsupervised clustering-based and pattern recognition with its leveraging to single, multi-view, and federated learning.


###### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

1. **Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU), Taiwan**<br/>
**Postdoc Fellow (March 5th, 2023 - March 15th, 2024)**<br/>
	- Developed soft and hard clustering algorithms to address multiple resources, clients or users data.
	- Served as a reviewer of information fusion (Elsevier) and IEEE Access.
 	- Provided (Matlab) codes that clearly manage the developed algorithms in visualizing and analyzing the problems of multiple resources and multiple clients or users data.
 	- Wrote academic papers that implemented a soft or hard clustering algorithm to assure efficiency, repeatability, and standardization in the use of multiple-resources data over multiple clients or users.
