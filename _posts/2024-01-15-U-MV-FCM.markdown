The rapid development in information technology makes it easier to collect vast numbers of data through the cloud, internet and other sources of information. Multiview clustering is a significant way for clustering multiview data that may come from multiple ways. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm for clustering (single-view) datasets was extended to process multiview datasets in the literature, called the multiview FCM (MV-FCM). However, most of the MV-FCM clustering algorithms and their extensions in the literature need prior information about the number of clusters and are also highly influenced by initializations. In this paper, we propose a novel MV-FCM clustering algorithm with an unsupervised learning framework, called the unsupervised MV-FCM (U-MV-FCM), such that it can search an optimal number of clusters during the iteration process of the algorithm without giving the number of clusters a priori. It is also free of initializations and parameter selection. We then use three synthetic and six benchmark datasets to make comparisons between the proposed U-MV-FCM and other existing algorithms and to highlight its practical implications. The experimental results show that our proposed U-MV-FCM algorithm is superior and more useful for clustering multiview datasets.</p>
