In June 2020, I graduated from Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) with a Ph.D degree in Applied Mathematics. I also earned my B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in Mathematics, from University of North Sumatera, Indonesia, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.In November 2020, I moved back to Indonesia for teaching in graduate program of BINUS university. In March 2023, I moved back to Taiwan for a postdoc in the Department of applied mathematics, CYCU. ***I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market. If you are interested in me, please drop me a message.***
